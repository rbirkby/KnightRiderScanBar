Knight Rider Scan Bar
=====================

Displays a Knight Rider style scan bar using an Arduino on a digital RGB LED strip. Uses a light chaser effect 
with a leading light oscillating back and forth along the length of the strip followed by a tail of lights 
each of diminishing intensity. The emulation is of a [K.I.T.T.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KITT) scan bar in red.

The LED strip used can be purchased from [AdaFruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/306) and is the variant using
an LPD8806 chip.
